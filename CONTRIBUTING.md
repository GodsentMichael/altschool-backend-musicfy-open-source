# Step 2 : Fork the Repo.

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>  
cd <repo-name>  
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upstream-owner>/<repo-name>  
  
  - If you already have the repo forked, update your repo before working!!
  
 git remote update
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase upstream/<branch-name
